# Aave Protocol V3 Periphery

This repository contains the Rewards Controller contract that allows to incentivize assets with multiple rewards in Aave V3 markets, UI helpers and others external smart contracts utilities related with the Aave Protocol V3.

## What is Aave?

Aave is a decentralized non-custodial liquidity markets protocol where users can participate as suppliers or borrowers. Suppliers provide liquidity to the market to earn a passive income, while borrowers are able to borrow in an overcollateralized (perpetually) or undercollateralized (one-block liquidity) fashion. To learn more you can checkout our [docs](https://docs.aave.com/hub/)
