# Rewards Controller

## Introduction

The Rewards Controller and Rewards Distributor contracts are aimed to bootstrap and incentive liquidity of deposits and borrows in the different Aave Markets with support of multiple rewards instead of only one as the previous version.

The `RewardsController` contract is responsible of configuring the different rewards and the claim process. Inherits `RewardsDistributor`.

The `Transfer Strategies` are isolated contracts that manages the procedure of the rewards transfer at claim. This allows the RewardsController to support any custom rewards, from Staked Aave incentives, common ERC20 transfers from vaults, or even NFT rewards.

The `RewardsDistributor` abstract contract manages the distribution and accountability logic of the multiple rewards per asset over time.

## Rewards Controller

The Rewards Controller is the main contract and where the user interacts to claim the rewards of their positions. It inherits `RewardsDistributor` to handle the distribution of rewards. The users of the incentivised ERC20 assets will accrue value if they hold their tokens in possession without the need of staking or blocking the assets inside a contract. At every transfer the asset must call the `handleAction` method to account for the accumulated rewards of the user prior to balance change.

The users can claim all the rewards or an individual reward per transaction, with a variety of functions that allow more granularity at claim.

| ------------------ | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Emission Manager   | Immutable                          | Allows to setup the emission configuration of the different rewards and enabling the _Authorized Claimer_ role for an address. Declared at RewardsDistribution contract as immutable at constructor.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Authorized Claimer | Mutable by _Emission Manager_ role | Allows whitelisted addresses to claim on behalf of another specified address. Useful for contracts that hold tokens that are incentivized but don't have any native logic to claim Liquidity Mining rewards. Declared at RewardsController contract, at the `_authorizedClaimers` internal mapping. Addreses can be enabled or disabled as _Authorized Claimer_ via `setClaimer` function, only callable by _Emission Manager_ role. |
